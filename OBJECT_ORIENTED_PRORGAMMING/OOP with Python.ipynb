    "    - Example: Using functions to encapsulate a process. The user calls the function with the appropriate arguments and receives the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Procedural abstraction\n",
    "    - Definition: Hiding the details of how a sequence of instructions is executed.\n",
    "    - Example: Using a loop to encapsulate a sequence of instructions that are executed repeatedly. The user only needs to know the starting and ending conditions of the loop.\n",
